## Description

    At first glance, it's just another text editor! But what makes this text editor special is the fact that its a PWA! What is a PWA you ask? PWA stands for Progressive Web Application. Which is really just a fancy way to say that it's a new and improved version of a traditional web application, that's been designed to store caches and cookies in a more effective way so that the user's experience is faster, all the more enjoyable. 

    In our case, J.A.T.E has been designed to be installable from the browser at the click of a button, making it available for offline, without compromising performance. 

    Not only that, J.A.T.E. uses localStorage and an indexedDB to back-up and save the content that the user adds to the notepad. 

## Installation

    1. Download repository
    2. Navigate to the root directory
